# JavaScript Quiz

Want to test your knowledge on some JavaScript? Step right up JavaScript Quiz! This short and sweet quiz will get you well on your way to learning the basics of JavaScript. And by the basics, I mean the _very_ basics. You've got 75 seconds to answer five questions relating to the coding language. Not bad, right? Be careful though, if you run out of time, the quiz will end short! Not only that, but if you get an answer wrong, the time will drop a whole TEN SECONDS! Your score at the end of this will be however much time you have left over! Try and get the highest score you can!!

As I made this quiz, I went through so many emotions. Confusion, anger, sadness, panic, happiness, and so many more! At the end of the day, however, coding this quiz helped me to better understand a lot of concepts I didn't quite get yet. I learned how to properly make a timer, how to use an array of object, as well as learned about functions even more. I almost feel like a pro with functions now! Hallelujah! I completely understand that there are things that I still very much do not understand and I also understand that with time and practice, I will get it, so I will continue to work hard to get there!

## Credits

A big thank you to one of my fellow classmates, Jonathan Canales for allowing me to use his rendition of the quiz as a reference so I could figure out what I needed to do for parts of this code!

Along with his code, I also followed a tutorial on YouTube by Web Dev Simplified, which helped me work through other struggles. Here's a link to his video!:
